# Workshop Automation
My new workshop needs some automation using an ESP8266, a Sonoff and other electronic parts

So my workshop is built but is it finished? Of course not! It needs some automation at the very least, including some help from an ESP8266 hub (probably), a 4-channel Sonoff and other Arduino-related peripherals. We'll discuss this imminent project in more detail here.

At least I have my component storage solution well under way, consisting of several storage bins and a spreadsheet to keep track of everything. I'll show you what I've come up with so far.

And because so many of you have expressed interest in the workshop itself, I've a time-lapse video showing it being built, with a cameo appearance by none other than Benny, my rescue cat. Was he impressed? You'll find out.
